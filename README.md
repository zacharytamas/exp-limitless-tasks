# exp-limitless-tasks

This project is a personal experiment using the Limitless AI API to detect certain things that I may say during my daily life and be able to take action on certain ones or at least gather together information about them and provide them to me so that I can take action on them.

It is primarily an experiment to explore the capabilities of the Limitless AI API and to see how it can be used to automate certain tasks in my daily life, but it may end up being more generally useful for others as well.
